Intermediate Deliverable for TO 414 Group Project 2

### Load Libraries

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(caret)
library(neuralnet)
library(rpart)
library(kernlab)
library(randomForest)
library(jtools)
library(interactions)
```

### Load in Data

```{r, cache = TRUE}
diamonds <- diamonds
summary(diamonds)
str(diamonds)
nrow(diamonds)
```

Data is from the ggplot2 library in R.

For the second group project, we have chosen a dataset on diamonds. This dataset has 10 variables which includes the price as well as various characteristics about diamonds. There are 53940 observations of data in this dataset. Our business question is: how should we price diamonds based on certain characteristics? We will answer this question by creating models to predict the price using a variety of characteristics about diamonds. This addresses the business problem of setting prices for a seller's inventory of diamonds since it is important to set reasonable prices based on what other similar diamonds are selling for.

### Clean Data

```{r, cache = TRUE}
# Make certain variables to be a factor 
# cut, color, clarity 
diamonds$cut <- factor(diamonds$cut, ordered = FALSE)
diamonds$color <- factor(diamonds$color, ordered = FALSE)
diamonds$clarity <- factor(diamonds$clarity, ordered = FALSE)

str(diamonds)
summary(diamonds)
```

Before moving to the analysis of the data set, we cleaned the data to prepare it for regression. Cut, color, and clarity were ordinal factors. We decided to change cut, color, and clarity to be factors which are not ordered.

### Regression

```{r, cache = TRUE}
diamonds_model <- lm(price ~ ., data = diamonds)
summary(diamonds_model)
```

We ran a linear regression model on the cleaned data with the response variable price and included all predictor variables. From doing this, we see that only variables y and z are not statistically significant at an alpha level of 0.05. All other predictor variables are statistically significant at an alpha level of 0.05 (and all of those are even statistically significant at an alpha level of 0.001). Because of having many statistically significant predictor variables at an alpha level of 0.05, we decided to go ahead and choose this dataset to use in this project to predict the price of diamonds.

### Split Data into Training and Testing Data

```{r, cache = TRUE}
# Get value of 70% of the data
num_training_data <- round(0.7 * nrow(diamonds))

# Get random sample of indexes for the training data
set.seed(123) # Set a seed
train_index <- sample(x = c(1:nrow(diamonds)), size = num_training_data, replace = FALSE)

# Get training data based on the train_index values randomly selected
train_diamonds <- diamonds[train_index,]
# Get testing data
test_diamonds <- diamonds[-train_index,]
# Check: make sure the number of values in training set and testing set 
# add to the number of rows in the original dataset
nrow(diamonds) == nrow(train_diamonds) + nrow(test_diamonds)
# Get summary of training and test data, make sure similar distribution of price values
summary(train_diamonds)
summary(test_diamonds)
```

70% of the data was randomly selected to be training data, and 30% of the data is testing data.

### Linear Regression 

```{r, cache = TRUE}

# 1162.9890409    0.9158249  744.0980344


# Improved Model
model3 <- lm(price ~ clarity + color + cut + log(carat) + depth + table + x + z + clarity*cut + clarity*color + color*cut + carat*color + depth*cut + depth*color + x*depth + z*depth + I(x^2), train_diamonds)

postResample(prediction_values_lm3, test_diamonds$price)
#  RMSE     Rsquared          MAE 
# 1033.2668851    0.9335579  628.8434045 

```

In order to create the best fitting linear regression model to predict price based on diamond characteristics, we first created the main effects model including all predictors, which had an RMSE of 1162.9890409, an R squared of 0.9158249 and MAE of 744.0980344. Next, we attempted to improve the model by assessing whether quadratic terms, log transformations, or interactions would help. When plotting the quantitative predictors against price, it appeared that the variable x had a quadratic relationship with price, so we added a quadratic term for this variable to the model. We also created histograms for the quantitative variables and found that the variable carat had a heavy right skew and may benefit from a log transformation. Additionally, we created some interaction plots, so by looking at these plots and just trying out different interactions in the model that intuitively made sense to us, we arrived at model 3. Model 3 has an RMSE of 1033.2668851, which is lower than the main effects model and other models we tried, an R squared of 0.9335579 which is higher than the main effects model and other models we tried, and an MAE of 744.0980344 which is lower than the main effects model and other models we tried. This model seems to best maximize all of these key metrics and do the best job at predicting price. 

### KNN Regression

```{r, cache = TRUE}
knnreg_model1 <- knnreg(price ~ ., data = train_diamonds, k = 5)

prediction_values_knn1 <- predict(knnreg_model1, test_diamonds)

postResample(prediction_values_knn1, test_diamonds$price)
#        RMSE     Rsquared          MAE

# Train the model to find kval
set.seed(300)
grid <- expand.grid(k = c(1, 5, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35))
ctrl <- trainControl(method = "cv", 
                     number = 10,
                     repeats = 10)

m <- train(price ~ ., data = train_diamonds, method = "knn",
           trControl = ctrl,
           tuneGrid = grid)
m
# k = 9 best 

knnreg_model_train <- knnreg(price ~ ., data = train_diamonds, k = 9)
summary(knnreg_model_train)
prediction_values_train_knn <- predict(knnreg_model_train, test_diamonds)
summary(prediction_values_train_knn)
postResample(prediction_values_train_knn, test_diamonds$price)
#        RMSE     Rsquared          MAE 
#1049.7342230    0.9348145  550.5465499 
```

To build the KNN model, we start with a basic model with k-val = 5. Running this model, we get RMSE of 1037.3289972, Rsquared of 0.9343628, and MAE of 540.2361728. Then in order to improve the accuracy of our model, we use train control and expand grid to figure our the most efficient k-val, which is 9. With the best k-vel, we build a new knnreg model setting k = 9. Cansequently, we get an improvement in accuracy, with RMSE of 1049.7342230, Rsquared of 0.9348145, and MAE of 550.5465499. This is a balance of RMSE and Rsquared.

Info about regression trees: https://www.datadriveninvestor.com/2020/04/13/how-do-regression-trees-work/

```{r, cache = TRUE}
# Chosen regression tree:
# One regression tree made with training data to predict price of testing data

# RMSE = 1423.7770949
# Rsquared = 0.8738465
# MAE = 909.6853036
```

A regression tree to predict price using all predictor variables which has an RMSE of 1423.7770949, Rsqaured of 0.8738465, and an MAE of 909.6853036.

```{r, cache = TRUE}
# Second regression tree

# RMSE = 1423.7770949, Rsquared = 0.8738465, and MAE = 909.6853036
# (gets same RMSE, Rsquared, and MAE as reg_tree_1)
# and only positive prices predicted:
#control_value = data.frame("minbucket" = 1000)

# RMSE = 1423.7770949, Rsquared = 0.8738465, MAE = 909.6853036
# (gets same RMSE, Rsquared, and MAE as reg_tree_1)
# and only positive prices predicted:

# RMSE = 2509.0156262, Rsquared = 0.6082208, and MAE = 1733.6869289
# and only positive prices predicted:
#control_value = data.frame("maxdepth" = 1)

# Choose this maxdepth to use for second regression tree:
# RMSE = 1686.5011751, Rsquared = 0.8230183, and MAE = 1061.1619385
# and only positive prices predicted:
control_value = data.frame("maxdepth" = 2)

# RMSE = 1423.7770949, Rsquared = 0.8738465, and MAE = 909.6853036
# (gets same RMSE, Rsquared, and MAE as reg_tree_1)
# and only positive prices predicted:
#control_value = data.frame("maxdepth" = 3)

# RMSE = 1423.7770949, Rsquared = 0.8738465, and MAE = 909.6853036
# (gets same RMSE, Rsquared, and MAE as reg_tree_1)
# and only positive prices predicted:

# RMSE = 1423.7770949, Rsquared = 0.8589778, and MAE = 909.6853036
# (gets same RMSE, Rsquared, and MAE as reg_tree_1)
# and only positive prices predicted:

reg_tree_2 <- rpart(formula = price ~ ., data = train_diamonds, control = control_value)
prediction_values_reg_tree2 <- predict(reg_tree_2, test_diamonds)
summary(prediction_values_reg_tree2)
postResample(prediction_values_reg_tree2, test_diamonds$price)
```

Regression trees were also fit with customizing model parameters predicting price using all the variables. In the models tested, either the value of "minbucket" was changed, the xval was changed, or the maxdepth was changed. Using a maxdepth of 2 provided the second best RMSE, Rsquared, and MAE values of all regression trees made. This regression tree has a RMSE of 1686.5011751, Rsquared of 0.8230183, and MAE of 1061.1619385. However, this best model was still not as good as the standard regression tree. The chosen regression tree is the one with default values for control from the rpart function and predicts price using all the predictor variables. This was chosen since it has the smallest RMSE and MAE values and the largest Rsquared value (and also had no extra parameters defined) compared to the other regression trees made. There were other regression trees which have the same RMSE, Rsquared, and MAE values; but those have an additional parameter defined, so the first regression tree was chosen as the one with no extra parameter defined. The chosen regression tree (and all the other regression trees made) only predicts positive price values when used on to predict on the testing data.

### Random Forest

```

Five random forests were created with varying amounts of trees to predict price using all predictor variables. 10, 100, 500, 200, and 50 trees were used. The random forest with 500 trees had the best RMSE, Rsquared, and MAE values among the other random forest models. The random forests with 100, 200, and 500 trees also has RMSE, Rsquared, and MAE values which are similar. In addition, the train function was used to test out the number of predictor variables chosen with 10-fold cross-validation. The chosen number of predictors to include is 9 since it has the lowest RMSE (it also has the lowest MAE and highest Rsquared value as well). The random forest with 500 trees was chosen since it has the smallest RMSE and MAE and the largest Rsquared value among the other random forests made. In addition, for the chosen model (as well as the other random forests created with different tree values), only positive price values are predicted for the testing data.

### Stacked Model

#                          prediction_values_ANN2, prediction_values_SVM2,

str(stack_model)
```

## New Test and Train
```{r}
stack_test_set <- sample(1:nrow(stack_model), nrow(stack_model) * 0.3) 
stack_train <- stack_model[-stack_test_set, ]
stack_test <- stack_model[stack_test_set, ]
```

## Stacked Regression Tree
```{r}
stack_rt <- rpart(formula = test_diamonds.price ~ ., data = stack_train)
stack_rt
summary(stack_rt)
stack_predictions_rt <- predict(stack_rt, stack_test)
postResample(stack_predictions_rt, stack_test$test_diamonds.price)
# RMSE = 842.2472785, Rsquared = 0.9547393, MAE = 533.0487923
```

RMSE, Rsquared, and MAE for the chosen models and the stacked model:

Linear regression:
- RMSE = 1033.2668851
- Rsquared = 0.9335579
- MAE = 628.8434045 

KNN regression:
- RMSE = 1049.7342230
- Rsquared = 0.9348145
- MAE = 550.5465499

SVM:
- RMSE = 689.49626
- Rsquared = 0.97049
- MAE = 353.32796

ANN:
- RMSE = 4.008756e+03
- Rsquared = 2.494753e-06
- MAE = 3.039719e+03

Regression Tree:
- RMSE = 1423.7770949
- Rsquared = 0.8738465
- MAE = 909.6853036

Random Forest:
- RMSE = 579.8030293
- Rsquared = 0.9792354
- MAE = 285.0036782

Stacked Regression Tree:
- RMSE = 842.2472785
- Rsquared = 0.9547393
- MAE = 533.0487923

Comparing the RMSE, Rsquared, and MAE values for the chosen models and the stacked model, the random forest seems to be the best at predicting price since it has the smallest RMSE and MAE values and has the largest Rsquared value. The chosen random forest contains 500 trees. However, using the stacked regression tree can be more robust since it takes in features from a multitude of model type. Therefore, the final chosen model will be the stacked regression tree which uses the predicted values from the chosen linear regression, KNN regression, SVM, regression tree, and random forest. The stacked regression tree has an RMSE of 842.2472785, Rsqaured of 0.9547393, and an MAE value of 533.0487923. This model does do a good job at predicting price based on the characteristics of diamonds. By doing this analysis, we are able to find a model which a seller of diamonds could use to price their inventory of diamonds. This results in potentially fairer prices since the pricing is based on the diamond's characteristics and how those characteristics impact price. By using this model to price one's diamonds for sale, the fair prices benefit both the seller (since they are not underpricing) and the buyer (since they are getting a fair price).

### Trying Out Some More Stacked Models
```{r}
# Not including random forest
# RMSE = 803.7886818, Rsquared = 0.9607508, MAE = 514.3504604
#stack_model_2 <- data.frame(prediction_values_lm3, prediction_values_train_knn,
#                            prediction_values_ANN2, prediction_values_SVM2,
#                            prediction_values_reg_tree1, test_diamonds$price)


# Not including random forest and not including ANN
# RMSE = 952.5851637, Rsquared = 0.9431477, MAE = 596.7643558 
# stack_model_2 <- data.frame(prediction_values_lm3, prediction_values_train_knn,
#                             prediction_values_SVM2,
#                             prediction_values_reg_tree1, test_diamonds$price)
# summary(stack_model_2)
# str(stack_model_2)
```

## New Test and Train
```{r}
# stack_test_set_2 <- sample(1:nrow(stack_model_2), nrow(stack_model_2) * 0.3) 
# stack_train_2 <- stack_model[-stack_test_set_2, ]
# stack_test_2 <- stack_model[stack_test_set_2, ]
```

## Stacked Regression Tree
```{r}
# stack_rt_2 <- rpart(formula = test_diamonds.price ~ ., data = stack_train_2)
# stack_rt_2
# summary(stack_rt_2)
# stack_predictions_rt_2 <- predict(stack_rt_2, stack_test_2)
# postResample(stack_predictions_rt_2, stack_test_2$test_diamonds.price)
```
